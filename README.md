# Quantitative analysis:
- The code for carrying out the quantitative analysis is present in `Final Image Crop Analysis.ipynb`. This code should use the `crop_api.py` and `image_manipulation.py` included in this repository (instead of the ones included in Twitter's official repository). These updated files automate the evaluation process and disable the display of images to ensure that execution time is low. 
- A GitHub gist for the notebook is provided here: https://gist.github.com/gaurav22verma/57b815339a2eeac831a97af4dff45eed. You can also open the notebook in Colab by clicking on the Google Colab link in the notebook.  
- This notebook can be used to run the code for all 5 types of biases that we have demonstrated by updating the directory from which the images need to be read (read the description of the dataset below) and updating the filenames.
